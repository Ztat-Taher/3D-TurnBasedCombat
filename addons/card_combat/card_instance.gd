class_name CardInstance
extends RefCounted
## Live instance of a card on the combat board. Pure logic, no scene dependency.

signal card_died(card: CardInstance)
signal card_damaged(card: CardInstance, amount: int)
signal card_revealed(card: CardInstance)

## Lifecycle triggers. The ability handler (injected by the game via ability_fn)
## reacts to these points; the engine does not know the concrete semantics of each
## ability. Each trigger fire carries a context Dictionary (see ability_fn).
##
## Instance-bound triggers fire on a concrete CardInstance: ON_SETUP,
## ON_TURN_REFRESH, ON_DEATH, ON_REVEAL, ON_ATTACK, ON_BLOCK, ON_DAMAGE_TAKEN,
## ON_DAMAGE_DEALT, ON_HEAL, ON_TURN_START, ON_TURN_END, ON_PLAY. The side-level
## ON_DRAW and ON_CAST fire with a null instance (the card has no board instance: the
## drawn card is still in hand, the cast spell is on its way to the graveyard), so a
## handler must tolerate inst == null and read context["card"] / context["owner"].
##
## ON_PLAY fires once, after ON_SETUP, when a creature is actually played onto the
## board (not on summon-bypass paths unless the engine fires it), carrying the chosen
## target in context["target"] (a battlecry's target, or null).
##
## ON_CAST is a side-level trigger fired once per spell (EFFECT card) cast, AFTER the
## spell's effects resolve, with inst == null and context {"card", "owner"}. It is the
## hook a game uses for spell-synergy ("whenever you cast a spell …"); the engine never
## reads what the spell does. Both ON_PLAY and ON_CAST are kept last so the enum values
## of the earlier triggers are unchanged for any persisted ordering.
