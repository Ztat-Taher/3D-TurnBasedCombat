class_name CombatAI
extends RefCounted
## Base contract for any AI driving a CombatSession. Subclass and override the
## five methods below (choose_card_to_play, choose_attackers, choose_attack_target,
## choose_spell_target, choose_blockers). The engine stays agnostic: an AI only
## operates on CardData and CardInstance, never on game-specific types. DummyAI is
## the reference implementation (random, optionally seeded).
##
## The default implementations are safe no-ops (empty pick / no action) and emit
## an error, so a partial subclass fails loudly instead of silently misbehaving.


func choose_card_to_play(_hand: Array[CardData], _mana: int) -> CardData:
	## Pick a card to play from hand given available mana, or null to stop.
	push_error("CombatAI.choose_card_to_play not implemented")
	return null


func choose_attackers(_board: Array[CardInstance], _enemy_heroes: Array[Combatant] = []) -> Array[CardInstance]:
	## Pick which own creatures declare an attack this turn. `enemy_heroes` lists the
	## living heroes of every enemy side (one in 1v1, several in FFA / team games), so
	## an AI can reason about lethal; it may be empty in board-only scenarios.
	push_error("CombatAI.choose_attackers not implemented")
	return []


func choose_attack_target(_attacker: CardInstance, _enemy_board: Array[CardInstance], _enemy_heroes: Array[Combatant] = []) -> Variant:
	## Pick a defending creature for the attacker (any enemy side's creature; each
	## carries its owner_id), or null to swing at a hero. When null, the engine sends
	## the hit to the first living enemy side. `enemy_heroes` is the combined enemy
	## hero list, for lethal reasoning.
	push_error("CombatAI.choose_attack_target not implemented")
	return null


func choose_spell_target(_spell: CardData, _own_board: Array[CardInstance], _enemy_board: Array[CardInstance]) -> Variant:
	## Pick targets for a spell that needs them. For a single-target spell
	## (PLAYER_CREATURE) return a living CardInstance, or null if none fits. For a
	## bounded multi-target spell (CHOSEN_CREATURES) return an Array of up to
	## target_count living CardInstances (returning fewer makes the spell fizzle/skip,
	## same as null for single-target). Both boards are the combined ally / enemy
	## creatures across sides (each carries its owner_id); inspect
	## `_spell.spell_effects` (a DAMAGE wants enemies, a HEAL/BUFF allies) to decide.
	push_error("CombatAI.choose_spell_target not implemented")
	return null


func choose_blockers(_attackers: Array[CardInstance], _own_board: Array[CardInstance]) -> Dictionary:
	## Map attacker CardInstance -> blocker CardInstance for incoming attacks.
	push_error("CombatAI.choose_blockers not implemented")
	return {}


func choose_play_target(_card: CardData, _own_board: Array[CardInstance], _enemy_board: Array[CardInstance]) -> Variant:
	## Optional: pick the target for a creature's on-play effect (a battlecry), used by
	## auto_resolve to fill the ON_PLAY context. Unlike the five core methods this is NOT
	## mandatory: the default returns null (no target), so an AI for a game without
	## battlecries needs no override and existing AIs keep working. Return a living
	## CardInstance (from either board, each carries its owner_id) or null.
	return null


func serialize_state() -> Dictionary:
	## Optional, agnostic state hook for save/resume. The default is empty: a
	## stateless AI needs nothing. An AI with internal state (e.g. a seeded RNG)
	## overrides this so a resumed combat stays deterministic without the caller
	## re-injecting the AI via deserialize hooks. CombatSession serializes whatever
	## this returns and feeds it back through restore_state().
	return {}


func restore_state(_data: Dictionary) -> void:
	## Counterpart of serialize_state(): rebuild the AI's internal state from the
	## serialized dictionary. Default is a no-op (stateless AI).
	pass
