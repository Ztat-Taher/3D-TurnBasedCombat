## Simultaneous damage calculation between creatures. Pure logic.

## Optional damage formula hook. Signature: (attacker, defender) -> int. When
## valid it fully replaces the default formula, letting the game layer factor in
## the defender (e.g. armor). Empty = engine default (attack, floored at 1).
