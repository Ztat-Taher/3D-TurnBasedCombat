## Alternating-turn combat FSM: orchestrates turns, decks, AI and damage
## resolution. The model is symmetric per `side` (0/1) and agnostic to who drives
## each side (human UI, AI or a network peer), which makes it PvP-ready. On every
## turn one side is ACTIVE (takes its turn and attacks) and the other is PASSIVE
## (declares blockers). turn_number counts half-turns (one per side turn).

## Optional spell-power hook. Signature: (owner_id: int) -> int. Returns a bonus added
## to the value of the caster's damage spells (built-in DAMAGE / AOE_DAMAGE and the
## ENEMY_HERO bolt), so a game can scale damage by board state ("+N spell damage").
## It travels in the spell context as "spell_power", so a custom effect_fn can read it
## too. Empty = no bonus. Re-injected via deserialize hooks.
var spell_power_fn: Callable = Callable()

## Optional aura recompute hook. Signature: (session: CombatSession) -> void. The engine
## calls it whenever board membership changes (a creature enters, is summoned, or dies),
## so a game can re-apply continuous_modifiers across the boards idempotently (a "lord"
## that buffs neighbours). The engine owns WHEN to recompute; the hook owns WHAT each

## How ability triggers are dispatched. INLINE (default) fires ability_fn the
## moment a trigger happens, exactly as before — a chained trigger resolves
## depth-first, mid-sweep. QUEUED defers every trigger into a FIFO queue drained at
## safe points (before each board sweep / at the end of each driver action), so a
## chain (a trigger that kills a creature that fires another trigger) resolves
## breadth-first in one flat order. Opt-in: set before setup(). Both are

## ability_fn runs later via _dispatch_trigger. Computed in setup()/deserialize.
